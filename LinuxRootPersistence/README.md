# LinuxRootPersistence
## Persistent Backdoor in 1 Second

> When run by the root user, this peace of code will create a root user "sysd" with the pass of "sickkick". After that 
the program will inject itself into systemd in a way that it can run as root when booted up. If for some reason you do not have
root on the system boot, you can always use the backdoor privilege escalation user "sysd".

This program can be modified to fit your personal use
